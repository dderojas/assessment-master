                Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in games.
                Remember how much fun you had growing up when you used to just go outside 
                and play with your friends? We advocate using the "compete to learn" approach 
                to practice--it lets kids play and have fun while competing. This type of 
                practice, using competitive drills, does a better job of preparing players 
                to compete in real games. Technically, this is called transference. What 
                you do in practice carries over into what you do in games.

                Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble knockout are 
                very popular. Every player must have his or her own basketball. Coach starts the game. 
                Every player must drible constantly, stay in-bounds and try to knock the ball away from 
                all other players in the game. Lose control of your basketball or go out-of-bounds, 
                and you're eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players could start as half the court. 
                After several players are eliminated, the boundary is reduced to only inside the 3-point 
                area. Boundary is reduced again to the free-throw lane. Finally, when there are just 
                two players left, they play the "finals" in the free throw half circle.
